# Utility Learn 
This is a library for personal use. "Learn by doing" is the best way I can describe the reason for this project to exist. Data structures & algorithms are a topic I've learned a while ago and in an effort not to forget what I've learned, I am using this project to refresh my memory. This also serves as an excuse for me to learn and practice writing Rust. As a language that has fascinated me, I find this a practical way to apply new knowledge and concepts of the Rust programming language as I encounter them whilst reading the Rust Book. 

## Features Implemented 
- Arrays 
    - Sorting 
        - Binary Search  
        - Linear Search

# TODO
1. Data structures such as linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, and hash tables.
2. Heaps and priority queues.
3. Graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and shortest-path algorithms.
4. Sorting algorithms such as selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
5. Algorithms for calculating common statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentile.
6. Algorithms for solving mathematical problems such as linear programming, integer programming, and dynamic programming.
7. Algorithms for text processing such as string search, string similarity, and natural language processing.
8. Algorithms for image processing such as edge detection, color quantization, and object recognition.
9. Algorithms for cryptography such as hashing, encryption, and digital signatures.
